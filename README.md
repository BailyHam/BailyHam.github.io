## Description
- Software Design and Engineering

The Animal Shelter Management System demonstrates robust software design and engineering principles. Key aspects include:

Modular Design: 

The project is divided into distinct modules, including the AnimalShelter class for database operations and various classes for GUI components (LoginScreen, RegisterScreen, MainApp, AddAnimalScreen, and UpdateAnimalScreen). This modular approach ensures that each component handles a specific functionality, enhancing both maintainability and readability.

User Interface: 

The application uses Tkinter to create a user-friendly interface. The GUI components are well-organized, providing a seamless user experience. Features such as form validation, error handling, and interactive elements (e.g., buttons and input fields) are implemented to ensure robustness. Additionally, the application supports a dark mode, demonstrating the ability to enhance user experience through customizable interface themes.

- Algorithms and Data Structures
  
The project showcases the application of algorithms and data structures through the implementation of searching and sorting functionalities:

Searching: 

Users can search for animals based on various criteria such as type, breed, age, and color. The search functionality utilizes regular expressions and MongoDB's query capabilities to perform case-insensitive and partial matches, demonstrating efficient use of algorithms to handle complex queries.

Sorting: 

The project includes both quick sort and merge sort algorithms to sort animal records based on selected attributes (e.g., animal ID, type, breed, age). These sorting algorithms are implemented to handle data efficiently, showcasing a deep understanding of algorithmic principles and their practical application in real-world scenarios.

- Databases
  
The use of MongoDB Atlas as the database solution highlights the project's ability to manage data effectively:

Database Connectivity: 

The AnimalShelter class manages the connection to the MongoDB Atlas database using the pymongo library. It includes methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, demonstrating proficiency in database management.

Data Storage: 

Animal records and user credentials are securely stored in the MongoDB database. The project ensures data integrity and consistency through proper database operations and error handling mechanisms.

Scalability: 

By using MongoDB Atlas, the application leverages cloud-based database services that provide scalability, high availability, and security features, aligning with industry standards for modern database management.
